# Control Rebind Manager
This is a Unity package to provide ready to use architecture to allow players to rebind the controls of a game at will. It is built on top of and dependant on my free and open source [Command Pattern](https://github.com/cmwedin/CommandPattern) package which must be downloaded separately.
